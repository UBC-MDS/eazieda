## Similar Work

We recognize EDA (exploratory data analysis) and preprocessing packages are common in the Python open source ecosystem. Our package aims to do a few things very well, and be light weight. A non exhaustive list of EDA helper packages in Python include:

- [`pandasprofiling`](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling)
    - One of the most function packed packages for automatic EDA. Produces a large HTML report accounting for statistics column by column, missing values, correlation checks, histograms etc. 
- [`sweetviz`](https://github.com/fbdesignpro/sweetviz)
    - This package produces very clean visuals detailing breakdowns in descriptive statistics and can do so with train/test sets for model building workflows.
- [`ExploriPy`](https://github.com/exploripy/exploripy)
    - This packages does the most common EDA tasks but also adds in the ability to do statistical testing using analysis of variance (ANOVA), Chi Square test of independence etc.
